**A second-generation brain model builder — organizing multi-scale computational neuroscience as a graph of reusable, schema-defined components, designed to be understood and operated by both humans and AI agents.**

## Why Neuro-Workflow?

Brain modeling today is fragmented. NEST, TVB, NEURON, and analysis tools each have separate APIs, data formats, and execution models.

Neuro-Workflow is a **second-generation model builder**. Unlike first-generation tools designed solely for human users (i.e. [SNNbuilder](https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2022.855765)), it organizes multi-scale brain modeling as a graph of reusable components — each a well-defined Python class with a schema describing its role, inputs, outputs, and parameters. This architecture was built from the ground up to be understood and operated by **both humans and AI agents**.

The key innovation is not the addition of LLMs — it is the **AI-ready infrastructure**. Because every node carries structured metadata, AI agents can support the modeling process through few-shot learning and protocols such as MCP (Model Context Protocol) without deep domain fine-tuning. Even small or locally deployed models can perform well, keeping computational overhead and token costs low.

This architecture enables:

- **Simulator interoperability** — NEST, TVB, NEURON, and custom solvers run as interchangeable nodes through a unified interface
- **Human + AI collaboration** — users and agents compose nodes into models, generate executable Python scripts and notebooks, and run simulations
- **AI-assisted parametrization** — agents retrieve parameter values from open data sources and suggest configurations grounded in the literature
- **Reproducibility by design** — workflows are serializable graphs; the same pipeline runs on a laptop or a supercomputer
- **Extensibility** — any Python function becomes a node; new simulators integrate without changing the core

> *"By providing well-documented, schema-defined nodes, Neuro-Workflow establishes a foundation for systematically organizing computational neuroscience functions, algorithms, and tools — enabling AI-augmented scientific discovery in which humans and agents jointly build, test, and extend brain models."*

## Current Status

### Neuro-Workflow Python API

Neuro-Workflow provides a comprehensive Python API for building and executing computational neuroscience workflows using a node-based system. The core functionality is organized as follows:

#### Node System

- **Node Storage**: All available nodes are stored in `src/neuroworkflow/nodes/`
- **Organization**: Nodes are organized in customizable categories for easy navigation
- **Extensibility**: New custom nodes can be created and integrated into the system

#### Creating Custom Nodes

For developers interested in extending Neuro-Workflow with custom functionality:

- **📋 Node Schema**: See `NODE_SCHEMA.md` for detailed node structure specifications
- **📝 Template**: Use `CustomNodeTemplate.py` as a starting point for new nodes
- **📖 Tutorial**: Follow `CUSTOM_NODE_TUTORIAL.md` for step-by-step node creation guide

#### Python API Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use the Neuro-Workflow Python API to create and execute workflows:

**Examples folder:**

- `sonata_simulation.py` - Basic simulation example
- `neuron_optimization.py` - Parameter optimization example (in development)
- `epilepsy_rs.py` - Epileptic resting state simulation using The Virtual Brain (TVB)

**Notebooks folder:**

- `01_Basic_Simulation.ipynb` - Interactive basic simulation tutorial
- `epilepsy_rs.ipynb` - Interactive epileptic resting state example with TVB
- `SNNbuilder_example1.ipynb` - Spiking Neural Network building with SNNbuilder custom nodes

### Neuro-Workflow Web Application

For users who prefer a graphical interface, Neuro-Workflow includes a comprehensive web application that provides visual workflow building capabilities.

#### Installation

To set up the web application, follow the detailed instructions in `gui/README.md`.

#### Important Setup Notes

**Node Synchronization:**

- The web app requires nodes to be copied from `src/neuroworkflow/nodes/` to `gui/workflow_backend/django-project/codes/nodes/`
- This copy is regularly performed by administrators
- **For developers**: If you create new custom nodes, ensure they are copied to the web app directory to make them available in the GUI

**Core API Synchronization:**

- The Python API base code from `src/neuroworkflow/core/` is also copied to the web application
- Web app location: `gui/workflow_backend/django-project/codes/neuroworkflow/core/`
- This ensures the web app stays synchronized with the latest API updates

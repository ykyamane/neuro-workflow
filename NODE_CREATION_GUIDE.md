# Node Creation Guide

A living reference for creating NeuroWorkflow nodes from existing brain models and tools.
Update the stage list and semantic guides as the library grows.

## Core Principles

1. **One node = one scientific operation at one stage.** Not one GitHub repo, not one line of code.
2. **Stage defines role.** The stage tells an agent *what this node does* in the modeling pipeline, even without reading the implementation.
3. **Tool defines context.** The tool/simulator tells an agent *what dependency is required* and what idioms to expect.
4. **Descriptions are for agents too.** Write `description`, port descriptions, and parameter descriptions as if an AI will read them to decide whether to use this node — because it will.
5. **Flexibility within stages.** Port names and types are not mandated across nodes. The stage semantic guide describes *what should flow*, not the exact variable names.

## Required Metadata Fields

Every node **must** declare these fields in `NODE_DEFINITION`:

```python
NODE_DEFINITION = NodeDefinitionSchema(
    type="unique_snake_case_identifier",   # globally unique
    stage="population",                    # see stage list below
    tool="NEST",                           # simulator, library, or "custom"
    model_source="https://github.com/...", # origin of the model/algorithm
    description="One clear sentence describing what this node does scientifically.",
    parameters={...},
    inputs={...},
    outputs={...},
    methods={...},
)
```

- `stage` — must match one of the stages listed below (or propose a new one)
- `tool` — the simulator or Python library this node wraps (e.g. `NEST`, `TVB`, `Brian2`, `NEURON`, `SNNBuilder`, `SciPy`, `custom`)
- `model_source` — URL to the paper, GitHub repo, or documentation this node implements

## Stage List

Stages represent steps in the brain modeling process. The list grows over time.

### `io`
Load and save data between the filesystem and the workflow.
- Typical inputs: file paths (connectomes, time series, imaging data)
- Typical outputs: in-memory data structures (arrays, dataframes, objects)
- Parameters: file paths, format options, subject/session IDs
- Examples: load DTI connectome, load fMRI time series, export simulation results

### `neuron`
Define a single neuron model — its dynamics, morphology, and intrinsic parameters.
- Typical inputs: configuration dicts or file paths
- Typical outputs: a neuron model object or parameter set
- Parameters: membrane time constant, firing threshold, adaptation, ion channels
- Examples: IAF neuron definition, Hodgkin-Huxley cell, morphologically detailed cell

### `population`
Define a group of neurons of the same or mixed types.
- Typical inputs: neuron model definition
- Typical outputs: population object (group of cells with shared properties)
- Parameters: number of cells, cell type distribution, spatial layout
- Examples: excitatory population, inhibitory interneuron pool, cortical column layer

### `synapse`
Define synaptic connection rules, dynamics, and plasticity.
- Typical inputs: pre/post population definitions
- Typical outputs: synapse specification object
- Parameters: synaptic weight, delay, receptor type, plasticity rule (STDP, etc.)
- Examples: AMPA synapse, GABA_B synapse, STDP rule, short-term depression

### `connectivity`
Wire populations together into a network using a connectivity rule or matrix.
- Typical inputs: populations, synapse specs, optional connectome data
- Typical outputs: connected network or adjacency structure
- Parameters: connection probability, weight distribution, topology (random, small-world, data-driven)
- Examples: random connectivity, structural connectome-based wiring, topographic map

### `stimulus`
Design external input signals delivered to the network.
- Typical inputs: population or target definition
- Typical outputs: stimulus object or signal array
- Parameters: amplitude, frequency, duration, waveform type, target region
- Examples: DC current injection, Poisson spike train, sinusoidal drive, sensory input protocol

### `simulation`
Execute the model and record its activity.
- Typical inputs: network (with connectivity and stimulus), simulation config
- Typical outputs: raw recorded data (spikes, voltages, LFP, BOLD)
- Parameters: simulation duration, time step (dt), recording devices, random seed
- Examples: NEST simulation run, TVB simulator, Brian2 run, NEURON simulation

### `analysis`
Compute scientific metrics from raw simulation or experimental data.
- Typical inputs: raw recorded data
- Typical outputs: derived metrics, statistics, figures
- Parameters: time window, bin size, metric selection, frequency bands
- Examples: firing rate calculation, power spectrum, spike synchrony, BOLD signal GLM

### `optimization`
Search or fit parameters to match a target or objective.
- Typical inputs: any stage node's parameters + objective metric
- Typical outputs: optimized parameter set, optimization trajectory
- Parameters: algorithm (Bayesian, evolutionary, grid), budget, objective function
- Examples: Bayesian optimization of synaptic weights, fitting to experimental firing rates

## Proposing a New Stage

The stage list above is a starting point, not a closed set. If a model from a source repository does not map cleanly to any existing stage, **propose a new stage** rather than forcing a bad fit.

A new stage is warranted when:
- The scientific operation is meaningfully distinct from all existing stages
- It would apply to multiple models or tools (not just one specific script)
- A neuroscientist would naturally describe it as a separate step in the modeling process

To propose a new stage:
1. Pick a short lowercase name (e.g. `morphology`, `plasticity`, `decoding`)
2. Write a one-paragraph semantic guide following the format above (role, typical in/out, typical parameters, examples)
3. Add it to this file in the appropriate position in the pipeline order
4. Create the folder `src/neuroworkflow/nodes/<new_stage>/` with an `__init__.py`

When in doubt, propose and document — a well-described new stage is better than a misclassified node.

## Granularity Rules

| Too fine | Too coarse | Right |
|---|---|---|
| `SetLeakConductance` | `RunFullBGModel` | `NESTStriatumPopulationNode` |
| `ApplyThreshold` | `BuildAndSimulateNetwork` | `TVBEpileptorNode` |
| `LoadOneFile` | `LoadAllSubjects` | `VNMLoadSubjectTimeSeriesNode` |

**Rule of thumb:** A node is the right size if a neuroscientist would describe it in one sentence and it produces a self-contained scientific object that another node can consume.

---

## Process: GitHub Model → NeuroWorkflow Node

1. **Read the model.** Understand what it computes, what parameters it exposes, what it produces.
2. **Identify the stage.** Which step of brain modeling does this represent?
3. **Identify the tool.** What simulator or library does it depend on?
4. **Define the scientific interface.** What are the meaningful inputs/outputs from a neuroscience perspective — not implementation details.
5. **Set parameters.** Extract every scientifically meaningful parameter with its default, range, and description.
6. **Mark optimizable params.** Which parameters would a researcher want to tune or fit?
7. **Write the node class.** Use `/create-node` skill as scaffold.
8. **Write for agents.** Descriptions must be specific enough that an AI can decide whether to connect this node to another without reading the implementation.

## Writing Descriptions for Agent Readability

Bad (too vague):
```python
description="Runs the simulation."
```

Good (scientifically specific):
```python
description="Executes a NEST spiking network simulation and records spike times and membrane voltages from designated populations."
```

Bad port description:
```python
"data": PortDefinition(type=PortType.OBJECT, description="Data")
```

Good port description:
```python
"spike_recorder": PortDefinition(type=PortType.OBJECT, description="NEST spike recorder device containing spike times and neuron IDs for all recorded populations")
```

---

## Output File Convention

Nodes that write files to disk (plots, CSVs, HDF5, spike recordings, simulator output directories) must follow this pattern:

```python
import os

def my_method(self, ...) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # 1. Context first, node parameter as fallback
    data_path = self._context.get("results_path", self._parameters["data_path"])

    # 2. Create the directory BEFORE any simulator initialization
    os.makedirs(data_path, exist_ok=True)

    # 3. Pass the path to the simulator after initialization
    #    (some simulators require absolute paths — check their docs)
    simulator.setup(output_path=data_path)
```

**Why this order matters:** The output directory must exist before the simulator tries to write to it. Reading from context first allows a single `results_path` set at the workflow level to propagate automatically to all nodes, without each node needing to independently configure the same path.

`WorkflowBuilder` defaults `results_path` to `"results/"` (relative to the working directory where `wf.build()` is called), and creates that folder automatically at build time. Users can set `results_path` to any path in the workflow context — the node always reads from context, so it adapts automatically. Nodes that only pass data in memory do not need to follow this convention.

## Checklist Before Committing a Node

- [ ] `stage` field is set and matches the stage list
- [ ] `tool` field identifies the simulator or library
- [ ] `model_source` URL is valid and points to the origin
- [ ] `description` is one clear scientific sentence
- [ ] All parameters have `description` and `default_value`
- [ ] Scientifically tunable parameters have `optimizable=True` and `optimization_range`
- [ ] `is_objective` / `objective_range` are only on `ParameterDefinition`, never on `PortDefinition`
- [ ] All port descriptions are specific enough for an agent to understand the data

- [ ] Node is placed in the correct `src/neuroworkflow/nodes/<stage>/` folder
- [ ] Import added to the stage `__init__.py`
